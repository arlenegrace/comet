Minimal single-page personal branding website.


## Features
- **Lightweight**: The entire visible webpage is written in just 21 lines of HTML and ~200 lines of CSS, making it easy to merge into a single HTML file to speed up page load times by reducing the number of HTTP requests to just one.
- **Responsive**: Automatically changes layout based on resolution and screen size, and dynamically switches between light and dark theme based on OS setting.
- **Dark theme**: Designed with aesthetics and readability in mind - the gray on gray color scheme is easier on the eyes and is more forgiving of whitespace compared to pure white.


## Usage
